# Um, Actually...
## About
A terrible, terrible little discord.py bot that tries to check your grammar.

The bot uses [Ginger](https://github.com/Azd325/gingerit) as it's primary parser, through [GingerIt](https://github.com/Azd325/gingerit), and also supports [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/), through [language_tool_python](https://github.com/jxmorris12/language_tool_python/).
Currently auto-accepts all suggestions.

## Planned Functionality
- A mode to show and let users manually accept individual suggestions
- More parsers
- More languages, implemented using LanguageTool
- Better punctuation correction, if i can find a punctuation checker API, or make my own punctuation checker.
